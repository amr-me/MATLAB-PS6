% inputs: 
% v: row vector on length n
% a: a scalar to find and replace in the new vector
% b: 1st new value "scalar"
% c: 2nd new value "scalar"

%% replace_me function
% It takes v and search through it for 'a' scalar, 
% when a is found, it replaces it with two values b&c.
% c is omitted: c = b
% b and c are omitted: b = 0; c = 0
function w = replace_me(v,a,b,c)
